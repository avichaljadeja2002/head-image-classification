#Things to do
- separate models for each classifier

- Maria: make emotions classifier
- Avi: keep training data, look into grayscale --> RGB conversion, ask profs about progress report grade
- Brian: person identification classifier
- Connor: run on personal PC if possible, make sunglasses classifier
- All: help each other out :D
